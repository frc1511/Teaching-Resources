# Github Setup
This is how to set up your github account with the team. We need to do this so you can easily share code with us and we can share code with you. This can also let you test your code in the web browser, but we'll get into that later.

## Account Creation
###### Skip [here](#joining-the-team) if you already have an account
###### _If you need more instructions [click here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github)_
1. Navigate the signup page at [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)
2. Enter your email, it can be a personal one or your school provided one. You will need access to verify.
3. Create a password
4. Create a username. This is public so keep that in mind, it doesn't have to be your name.
5. Select USA for the country
6. Complete the email confirmation, it should have sent the code to your inbox.
7. Sign into your account


## Joining the Team {#joining-the-team}
At this point you should have your account set up. We need to know your account handle to add you, so here's where to find it.

1. Go to github.com when you are logged in
2. Click your circle profile picture in the top right
3. Select the profile option
4. Your handle should be below your username, it's probably just the same as your username anyway.

Fill out the form that should be posted in teams in the programming channel. This will let us add you to the team. If you need help, reach out to us on teams.
