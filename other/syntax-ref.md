# Syntax Refrence
Here you'll find a quick refrence to some basic java syntax.

#### Built-In Data Types
* `String` - Stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes.
* `int` - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123.
* `double` - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, like 19.99 or -3.14159265. Double values end with `d`. (for people with experience, we will not be using `float` in our code).
* `char` - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
* `boolean` - stores values with two states: `true` or `false`

#### Variables
```java
type variableName = value;
```
Assignment:
```java
variableName = newValue;
```
Example:
```java
String greeting = "Hello World";
double treeHeight = 12.2d; // meters
int funnyNumber = 67;
```
